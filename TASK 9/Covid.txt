#Task9 : Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau. ● Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story ● Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts ● Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the charts and giving recommendations. 

Objective here is to explore the dataset to find weak areas and derive problems to increase profits as a Business Manager.
